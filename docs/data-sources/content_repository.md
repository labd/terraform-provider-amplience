  Content Repositories function as subfolders inside of Hubs. Although a user can view content in all repositories within a single hub, their ability to create content may be limited to certain repositories. Typically you will want your content producers to be able to create content in one or more repositories, but your planners to only be able to view the content. Content and slot types are registered with hubs and enabled on repositories. So you can choose which types of content can be created in each repository, or just choose to limit the number of content types that are available.
