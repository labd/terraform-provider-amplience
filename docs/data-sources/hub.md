  Permissions are set at the hub level. All users of a hub can at least view all of the content within the repositories inside that hub. Content cannot be shared across hubs. However, content can be shared and linked to across repositories within the same hub. So you can create a content item in one repository and include content stored in another. Events and editions are scheduled within a single hub. So if you want an overall view of the planning calendar across many brands, then you may wish to consider a single hub. However, in some cases you may want to keep the calendars separate. Many settings, such as the publishing endpoint (the subdomain to which your content is published) are set at a hub level. Multiple hubs may publish content to the same endpoint.
